# USA-Parking-Analysis
In this exploratory data analysis we used numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries for data preprocessing and getting different insights.
This data set contains data from different states of USA with their parking conditions.                                                                                   According to the state, city and property type we analysed this data set with the help of different functions like pivot table, group by etc. We also answered 10 different business problems according to the business requirements.
